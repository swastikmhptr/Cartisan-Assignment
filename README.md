# Cartisan-Assignment
This Repository contains My work of Creating 2 models to classify images in CIFAR10 Dataset, there are two models, the first one is completely custom made with scratch Python and only using numpy, while the second one is made using transfer learning with Resnet50.

For Task1 3000 entries are used for train and 300 are used for test
For Task2 7000 entries are used for train and 1000 Entries are used for Test
(The above values are taken because of time and computation constraints)

The data has been aquired from the website:- https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

For Task1 The data has been compressed as rar file because of space issues in github, please extract before use
